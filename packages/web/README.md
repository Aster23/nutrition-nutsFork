# Web Package (frontend)

## Getting started
- I really like VSCode for Typescript stuff. I highly recommend using it
- Make sure you have npm installed and in your path (run `npm` and see if you get an angry message about the command not being found) 
- In this directory, run `npm i`

## Running the application
- In a terminal, run `npm start`. Head to `localhost:8080' to see!
