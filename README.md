fwiw I like to use four terminal tabs when I do dev on this kinda stuff. Two for the backend (building and serving), one for the frontend, and one to have a free terminal for like git and stuff. kinda clumsy and there is prob a better way but it works for me

## Quick overview
React frontend on an express backend, everything in Typescript. Frontend talks to the backend over the https REST api (much of the complexity is abstracted by express)

## Recommendations
BIG recommend vscode. Here are some of the extensions I use that could be helpful
- Prettier - Code formatter
- HTML CSS Support
- Auto Close Tag
